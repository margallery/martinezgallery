Works of 100 graffiti writers, as they call themselves, were auctioned last week. The artists attended in force. Above, Bama, center, reintroduced Case 2, right, to Stay High 149, friends who had not seen each other for 25 years.

<p>  Some call themselves artists, others boast 
that they are true vandals. Some, who have 
retired to the comfort of suburban homes 
and respectable careers, or who now show 
their work in galleries, carefully spell out 
their names for reporters. Others, who still 
prowl city streets, rooftops and subway tunnels, don't dare give their names.

<p> They are part of a subterranean fraternity 
born more than three decades ago when the 
first of  them began scrawling their names 
on walls, but many had never met until last 
week, when two concurrent graffiti events 
drew them to New York or out of their 
concrete city hideaways. On Wednesday 
night Guernsey's Auction House put the 
work of some 100 graffiti writers, as they 
call themselves, on the block; and on Saturday night two galleries in Williamsburg, 
Brooklyn, State of the Art and Bellwether, in 
collaboration with the Martinez Gallery in 
Manhattan, opened "The Painted Word," a 
retrospective of graffiti art since 1969, to run 
until July 16.

<p> "This isn't only a gathering, it's a historic 
occasion," said Wicked Gary, who was a 
member of the Experienced Vandals, otherwise known as the Ex-Vandals, a graffiti 
crew formed in 1970.

<p>  The work sold poorly at the auction, with 
pieces expected to go for at least $10,000 
selling at $3,000, and a painting by Lady 
Pink, one of the few women who have become famous graffiti writers, going for just 
$750. Arlan Ettinger, president of Guernsey's, declined to sum up the profits, and 
said only that sales were "up and down." 
Although some of the artists milled about the 
room wearing grim expressions, many 
sloughed it off, saying the important thing 
was that everyone had come together for 
what was the first unofficial graffiti reunion.

<p> But even though there was clearly much 
admiration among some artists, who traded 
auction catalogs collecting one another's  signatures, or tags, many of the artists spent 
the week settling old scores and trying to 
validate their places in the graffiti pantheon. 

<p> "It's like cleaning shop," said Michael 
Tracy, or Tracy 168, who wrote "wild style" 
graffiti starting in 1969. "Now that we're all 
in one room, you can't say this guy innovated 
this, because I can say, 'Oh yeah?' and walk 
across the room and see if they did it."

<p> Both the auction and the gallery shows 
feature the work of several "old school" 
train writers, like Taki 183, Case 2, Flint 707 
 and Bama, as well as pieces by artists who 
achieved gallery fame in the 1980's, like 
Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and Jean-Michel Basquiat. And there is also a significant 
representation of work by new, young graffiti writers  -- like M&ouml;sco, Giz and Nato -- who 
are still trying to redefine the genre on city 
streets.

<p> Many of the older writers, who started 
painting trains when hippies were still a 
novelty, said the auction -- in which the four 
pieces by Kenny Scharf failed to sell at all -- 
would help put the work of "art stars" in 
perspective. Some felt they were overlooked 
in the 1980's, when a small coterie of art 
school graduates became the toast of the 
downtown gallery scene without first paying 
their dues in the train yards.

<p> "In the 80's the work was redefined by 
galleries and some of the artists and curators started creating this terminology, like 
'iconoclastic panderism' and 'post-graffiti,' " said Roberto Gualtieri, 43, who started 
writing his name, CoCo, on the backs of city 
buses in 1969. "It's a lot of hype. Part of the 
criteria of being a writer was street credibility. Whoever doesn't have it is worthless."

<p> But those who spent years selling work in 
galleries said it took a different set of skills 
to make it there. 

<p> "It's like two different spheres," said Aaron Charles Goodstone, also known as Sharp, 
who has shown in galleries, primarily in 
Europe, since 1983. "There are some people 
who have been able to eke out a living on 
canvas and have had the wherewithal to be 
in the public arena. You have to be able to 
travel, and talk about your work articulately 
and show up. Anybody who is a working 
artist in the context of the studio has a whole 
different set of expectations."

<p> These arguments tend to bore younger 
graffiti writers, who have tried to stretch the 
form in recent years under increasingly 
harsh conditions. The Giuliani administration now spends about $25 million a year 
fighting graffiti, and 10 years ago the Transit 
Authority instituted a "clean car" policy, 
which dictates that no train leave the yard if 
it is marked. And while in the 1970's those 
caught vandalizing subway cars were given 
a couple of days in jail and required to clean 
up their scrawls, a graffiti writer caught 
today faces felony charges. 

<p> "I've come to realize that's just the graffiti ego: no matter how you write, whoever 
wrote just before you is the best, and the 
people who write just after you are the 
worst," said Kunle Martins, a 20-year-old 
from the Bronx who writes Earsnot, which 
he said stands for "Extravagant Artist Renovating Styles Not Orthodoxed to Taggers." 
"It's like as soon as you get a tiny little bit of 
fame you think everyone else is toy," or 
someone who copies other's hieroglyphics.

<p> Teenagers carrying backpacks filled with 
spray cans and artist's black books lined up 
agog in front of legendary writers like Case 2 
and Mico, who are now in their 40's. And 
though there was clearly admiration here, 
the younger generation, which paints on 
rooftops, trucks and walls inside subway 
tunnels, was skeptical about the nature of 
the event, arguing that even the pioneers had 
lost the true spirit of the genre. 

<p> "This is nice and all, but it's not graffiti," 
said Giz, 23,  who paints "throw-ups," or his 
name in bubble letters, on the sides of trucks, 
stores and police stations. "A lot of people 
forget that graffiti is street art, it's not 
gallery art. This is the first time that graffiti 
is starting to get civilized, but you still got to 
keep it on the ground, otherwise it's not 
worth anything."

<p>  But Rich Admiral, who has been known as 
Bama on the street since 1969 and has sold 
paintings in galleries since 1973, said that 
graffiti had always struggled between those 
two poles. He looked around the gallery, 
watching his compatriots, three generations 
of night scrawlers, gather and debate.

<p> "You realize that everyone in this room is 
insane," he said affectionately. "It's not normal to want to go out in the middle of the 
night and write your name on a wall. We all 
have our personal ghosts, and we all have 
our dirty laundry and rivalries. But it's like 
any family, and this is my family."
