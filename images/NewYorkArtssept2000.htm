</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>"June 14, 9:35 AM. Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like another hot and sweltery day.  Metro North trains into Grand Central Station were delayed this morning due to a fatality.  A 14-year-old boy fell to his death while he was apparently applying graffiti in a tunnel.  He stumbled, fell on to the tracks, and was killed instantly.  Police are seeking two juveniles who were spotted at the time of his death for questioning."  And so the life of another kid with dreams of joining the ranks of the legendary Graf writers comes to a screeching end.   After more than twenty years in New York, I realize I must be getting jaded.  I'm struck by the irony of this kid's death because tonight is the first of a two-night extravaganza organized by Guernsey's, the first ever "Auction of Graffiti Art." </P>
<P> It's also ironic that the entire concept of Graffiti runs counter to every tenant of capitalism.  Why should one pay and pay big for something that is inflicted on society for free?  All you would have to do is nail up a piece of primed plywood in any one of dozens of neighborhoods, come back in two weeks, and BAMMO, fresh Graffiti.  No matter how much Guernsey's expected to make from this sale, it's a mere pittance compared to the millions paid by the state to try to stem the blight.  If nasty mayors, get tough governors, and whole squads of undercover cops can't deter the desire to write, then how about lousy auction prices?</P>
<P>I'd promised the dealer that I'd pick her up in the car for the next studio visit.  She'd been mugged while coming to Brooklyn on her first trip and I was feeling paternal.  Driving back into Manhattan we drop her at the Broadway Lafayette stop.  It's 6:00 PM and the action is about to start at the Puck Building.  My 13-year-old son, who thinks Graf is cool, accompanies me. (He'd better never get on the tracks.)  I've been researching and interviewing writers and the scene for this magazine for the last six months.  I've known and followed some of their careers for years, and I know dealers and curators that have supported the movement, so I'm obliged to try and stay on top of things.  </P>
<P>          There's been a load of presale publicity for the last two or three months including a half-page color spread in the New York Times, banner headline adds online at artnet.com, as well as strong word of mouth.  Expectations are running high.  The Times article mentions a humongous canvas that was painted in the early 70's by Snake 1, COCO 144, Phase 2, and the United Graffiti Artists crew.  It's been rolled up in a garage in New Jersey for the last 15 years.  Estimates run as high as $100,000 for this "Piece."  A Downtown sign tagged by Taki 183 in 1969 is priced at $20,000.  The "Black Door" from "51X" 1981-84, a heavily tagged hollow core door to the gallery's inner sanctum, was estimated at $15,000.</P>
<P>&#9;Thanks to some smooth talk (being a member of the press does have its benefits,) we're compted admission and given one of the beautiful yellow catalogues.  Hugo Martinez is standing near the door and introduces his crew of writers, some of whom I've met or spoken to on the phone.  I get more tags on the catalogue than an A1 piece book.  Snake 1, Bama, COCO 144, and NATO all sign in.  As the bidding starts we slide into seats behind Rich Colichio, Kiely Jenkens, and someone that I haven't seen in the city for years, Patti Astor.  She's now a stunning redhead, and life in LALA Land must agree with her because she looks "Maahvaluss."  </P>
<P>Things start off fast. The auctioneer is wasting no time in presenting the lots.  Of the three above-mentioned items, not one reached its reserve.  This was a harbinger for the rest of the evening.  There was outspoken disappointment in the way the auctioneer handled the sale.  Because of her lack of knowledge of the context of the work, as well as the interests of the audience, the presentation was cursory, and the shear number of lots (381) made speed a factor.  A few bidders seemed to be picking up a lot of bargains, or were they working for Guernsey's trying to kite the prices?  There were also some European and Japanese dealers on shopping sprees.  </P>
<P>A few surprises: Rammelzee's works consistently brought in prices in the mid-thousands, though below their estimates of $15,000 to $20,000.</P>
<P>The late Dondi White's works came closest to reaching their estimates, $5,000 to $6,500 for pieces estimated at $8,000 to $10,000.</P>
<P>Keith Haring's chalk on black advertising blanks didn't fair well.  A small one sold for $7,000 and two other larger pieces passed at $15,000.  Several large spray-can pieces on plywood from construction sites didn't receive a single bid.  This may be in part due to Shafrazi's refusal to certify, as authentic, any of the subway works because of rumors of numerous fakes.   However, as soon as the last Haring piece closed, a sizable group of well -dressed collectors left in mass, which says something about the loyalty of his patrons. </P>
<P>&#9;The second night was better.  The top price of $22,000, went to lot 281A, the apartment door above Gallery 51X, 1979-83, a door tagged by Haring, Basquiat, Fab Five Freddie, Futura, Zepher, Revolt, and even Johnny Rotten.  Another highlight was a case of  "Crylon Spraypaint," estimated at $400 to $600 that started a bidding war and was hammered down at $2,100.  The evening started with items in the $300 to $1000 price range, and seemed to loosen up the bidding.  Kenny Sharf's pieces didn't receive a single bid, but many other works went for bargain prices.</P>
<P>&#9; After the first night I spoke to some of the dealers to get their impressions.  Hugo Martinez, always the optimist, opined "It's kind of funny.  I thought that they would've done a better job of getting the word out, but it doesn't seem like any of the collectors are here.  At least we're down to earth now.  We needed to deconstruct.  This shows us where the bottom is.  Now we can start to climb the ladder."  Rich Colicchio was a little down, but thought all in all it was a good thing.  "It was good for the whole scene.  They (the writers) were all happy, a little disappointed, but everyone got in the catalogue.  They were featured on "Good Morning America," the CBS news, as well as German and Japanese TV.  I've heard that Guernsey's spent about $2,000 per artist between renting the Puck Building, the catalogue, and the advertising.  Looks like those poor guys took a bath."  </P>
<P>&#9;Two days latter, almost as an addendum, The State of Art Gallery in Greenpiont opened their show "The Painted Word."  This show was like a class reunion and an opportunity for the artists to exhibit work without the pressure of the auctioneer's hammer coming down on their heads.  The old lions and the "newbies" were brushing shoulders.  Babies and extra fat markers were running wild.  It was like the United Nations of Graf writers.  Kids getting tags in piece books, celeb writers mugging for snapshots, TV cameras, and a flock of media types feeding on the hype.  </P>
<P>The West coast was represented by the likes of Chaz, one of the senior practitioners from West LA, and Mosco, an ambitious kid from Mexico City, who has tagged his way up the Coast and now resides in NYC.  New York had Case 2, one of the oldest and most intelligent of the local crews, a guy who lost an arm and a leg but still hasn't slowed down, and Futura 2000, a personality who some see with ambivalence due to his ability to capitalize on the scene.  As I've mentioned in previous articles, there are a number inside beefs and frictions between some of the different factions of the Graf world.  I won't go into that here.  Suffice it to say that there were a lot of happy Graffiti folks, and who knows, maybe we'll see a continuation of interest in exposing more of the historic and cultural aspects of this oh so American art form.                </P>
