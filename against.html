          The Against <br>

            As we all know, Against is a preposition that used in a sentence to express opposition to or to prepare for something. As this unusual noun of our title suggests,
            we are referring to someone or something opposed to, hostile to, resistant to, in
            disagreement with, contra, versus, in defiance… That’s what The Against puts in
            place at two simultaneous exhibitions that Martinez Gallery is organizing: the uncontrollable compulsion of graffiti bombing against the current.<br><br>
            The idea started by focusing on people who were exceptional, if not masters,
            of graffiti bombing from different regions of the country in the last decade. The
            objective was to take these artists, bring them together in one place, and see how
            they create as part of a shared experience in New York, arguably the mecca of
            graffiti bombing. The main theme, the subject of these exhibitions, is the very product of these masters working together. In the realm of graffiti, it’s very hard to get
            the very top artists all the time, because some of them are either incarcerated, or
            they won't show at galleries. But the ones selected are the top bombers available.<br><br>
            Bringing 21 bombers together from different parts of the US, Canada and Mexico
            —rooming together and sharing styles and techniques— will be a singular experience for those involved in the encounter; a gathering of talents; a dream team
            of graffiti.<br><br>
           The Martinez Gallery has done several exhibitions focusing on different themes, social issues, health issues, and a variety of topics related to our daily life. It has also organized The 90s show, and we think The Against artists might just be worlds apart. As the evolution from the 90s to now has shown, you must be more well-versed in art now, even as a bomber. We can say that the world of graffiti is ever-growing in this changing context. The Against presents an ideal opportunity to discuss and assess what bombing is today in comparison.
<br><br>
In addition to the installations, the concurrent exhibitions include some 100 drawings. And, through the website, Martinez Gallery will offer information and visual materials, disclosing and sharing the developments of these encounters. Photographers, videographers, and writers will provide an exceptional, ongoing account of these artists and events.
